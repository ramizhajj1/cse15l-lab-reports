# Lab Report 1
## Welcome to CSE 15L: *Software Tools and Techniques*!  

In this class, many skills that are beneficial in programming will be taught, practiced, and demonstrated through skill checks and lab reports.
  
  
To start things off, I will be talking about remote access and logging in to your course specific account!  
  
  
## Logging In To Your Account  
  
Every CSE student has a course-specific account which they can log in to using their UCSD username and student PID. Upon logging in with these credentials, the screen should look like this. It may be necessary for the student to change their password.

## Installing and Using VSCode

Installing and using VSCode is an important part of this class. Here we will be writing and executing a lot of our code. To install VSCode, you will want to go to the following link: https://code.visualstudio.com/, and follow the instructions to download and install it on your computer. This link includes versions for all the major operating systems, like macOS (for Macs) and Windows (for PCs).     

The good thing about VSCode is that if installed on your own device, you can connect whenever you want from wherever and code there. Once installed, it should show you a screen like this. Mine already has a few directories because I had it previously installed.

Once you are into VSCode, you can create files, folders, and start running code. You can even open up a terminal and run commands through VSCode.
